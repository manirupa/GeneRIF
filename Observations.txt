Observations:
============
1 - For Across-Gene training the Between-Gene cosine similarity scores go up as vector sizes go up
    The opposite is true for Within-Gene cosine similarity values, i.e. they go down as vector sizes go up
    
2 - For Within-Gene training the Within-Gene cosine similarity scores go "down" as vector sizes go up
    The Between-Gene cosine similarity values also go "down" as vector sizes go up
    
2 - Across-Gene training captures more variation across genes for "between-gene" similarities

3 - For finding similarities across genes, within-gene training may not be efficient or desired at all

4 - We use the DBOW method for training, where a word/phrase is predicted by it's surrounding words

5 - From the results we cannot be sure that smaller vector sizes and smaller context windows are good
    settings to use for training as we initially believed
    
6 - We can be sure our process is correct as results yield geneRIF records with distance 1.0 for within-gene sims
for across training and for between-gene sims for within-gene training.

7 - Across-gene training may be better for between-gene similarities and within-gene training for
    within-gene similarities


Papers Read (and notes):
========================
1 - Improving disease gene prioritization using the semantic similarity of Gene Ontology terms 
2 - FunSimMat update: new features for exploring functional similarity. Schlicker A, Albrecht M.
     
Notes: 
- Diseases of major importance to public health such as cancer or diabetes are often polygenic and
information about genes and gene products present as text 
- MedSim -  method for ranking  candidate genes for disease of interest based on 4 different strategies
for annotation using GO, AS-base, AS-ortho, AS-inter, AS-sem
- FunSimMat - is a comprehensive database providing various precomputed functional similarity values for 
proteins in UniProtKB and for protein families in Pfam and SMART. They have also significantly increased
 the coverage of FunSimMat by adding data from the Gene Ontology Annotation project as well as new 
 functional similarity measures

3 - A Web-based Kernel Function for Measuring the Similarity of Short Text Snippets 

Notes: 
-A method for using query expansion via web search result terms to represent "short text snippets"
and then use a cosine based Kernel function defined on these expanded query context vectors to correctly 
identify or highly rank semantically similar pairs of short text snippets "that do not share common terms", 
e.g. "Kofi Annan" with "UN Secy General", and Larry Page correctly as "Google founder" and "former CEO", 
Steve Ballmer as "Microsoft CEO", Bill Gates closer to "MS founder" than "CEO".

-Completely unsupervised 

4 - Short Text Similarity with Word Embeddings
Method to accurately predict semantically similar short text pairs, using a supervised learning approach
with training pairs and using ontologies and semantic network to create contextual feature vectors for each pair

Notes:



Next Steps:
==========
- Obtain OMIM dataset
- See if possible to leverage FunSimMat REST API to already gain access to precomputed gene, protein similarities
w.r.t diseases
- See how to apply Web Kernel based similarity instead of cosine similarity for SimGeneRIF and SimGene
- Look at possible combination of supervised and unsupervised approaches and what semantic features from
the (short text) papers can be used in our training, as well as correct vector sizes, context window to use.
